<h1>Coursework</h1>

<p>The program requires 33 hours of coursework and may be taken either full-time or part-time. Full-time students who already have taken all required prerequisites may be able to complete the program in one full year (3 semesters) of study. Part-time students and full-time students who need prerequisites will typically need from 1 1/2 to 3 years to complete the degree.</p>

<p>Early in the first semester, a student and the program advisor will work together to complete a formal Program of Study that will define a coherent sequence of courses to satisfy the student's objectives. A student may have the option to complete a Master's Thesis or a Practicum project, depending upon the availability and approval of a faculty sponsor.<p>

    <h2>Technical core (12 credits)</h2>
<p>The following four courses provide a solid understanding of state-of-the-art research and practice in technical areas of Information Systems.</p>

<h3>ISM 6124 (3 credits) - Advanced Systems Analysis and Design</h3>

<p>The goal of this course is to provide the technical and managerial foundations of software engineering and information systems development. Based on a prerequisite understanding of basic systems concepts, the course teaches how to manage and perform activities throughout the software-intensive systems development life cycle, from the analysis of system requirements through system design to system implementation, testing, and maintenance. The roles of creative and analytic thinking are highlighted throughout the software development processes. Current best practices in systems development are presented and research challenges are discussed.</p>
